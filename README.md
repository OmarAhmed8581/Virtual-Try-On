# Virtual-Try-On

With the advanced technology growth, online shopping as known as e-shopping has grown exponentially throughout the world nowadays. Advances in e-shopping have driven a shopping revolution where customers are able to purchase items anywhere and anytime. Despite the benefits of e-shopping, the main drawback is the difficulty for online shoppers to try items on especially for clothing. Hence, a virtual fitting room using machine learning is proposed to be developed as a web application to allow shoppers to visualize how clothing looks and fits on their bodies without wearing it actually. This is to improve shoppers’ shopping experience by giving them an ability to virtually try clothing on in order to check for size, fit or style. In this development, machine learning, human body detection and motion tracking are integrated to fit the model of garment to user’s body in real-time by tracking user’s body movements through the smartphone camera. The body skeleton-joint positions are recognized, detected and tracked using pose estimation model. In addition, the body and garment measurements are also analyzed and interpreted to help in seamlessly
